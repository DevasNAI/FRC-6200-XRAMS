# FRC-6200-XRAMS
This is the 2019 XRAMS Competition Code, this was the code used in our regionals and the Houston Championship.


This was the first time we used Java programming in our robot, and the programming lead made it as a Timed Robot because we were learning the  way.

Our off season project was to learnhow to make a Command Base robot, where we reprogrammed our 2018 Robot with Java, the code will be posted soon.
